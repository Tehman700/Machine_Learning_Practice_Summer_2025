## 📚 Current Focus: KNN Classification on Forest CoverType Dataset

### 📦 Files

- `KNN_Algorithm.py`: Implementation of the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm from scratch.
- `KNN_in_Sklearn.py`: Using `scikit-learn`'s built-in **KNeighborsClassifier**.
- `KNN_Using_CSV.py`: Applies KNN on data loaded from a `.csv` file.
- `KNN_Applied_on_ForestCoverTypeDataset.py`: Full pipeline using the **Forest CoverType** dataset.
- `covtype.data`: The dataset (CSV format) used for prediction tasks.

### 📊 Dataset: Forest CoverType

- 54 input features (numerical + one-hot encoded categories)
- 1 target column: `Cover_Type` (7 forest types)
- Real-world terrain data like elevation, slope, aspect, soil type, etc.

## 🔮 Future Goals and Expansion

I will be expanding this repository to cover:

### ✅ 1. **Regression Problems**
- Linear Regression (Single and Multiple Variables)
- Polynomial Regression
- Ridge, Lasso, and ElasticNet
- Regression evaluation metrics: MSE, MAE, R²
- Real-world datasets: House Prices, Bike Sharing, etc.

### ✅ 2. **Deep Learning (Using TensorFlow & PyTorch)**
- Perceptrons and Feedforward Neural Networks
- Activation functions (ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh)
- Backpropagation and Optimization
- Classification and Regression with Neural Nets
- CNNs (for image data) and RNNs (for sequence data)

### ✅ 3. **Generative Models (GANs - Generative Adversarial Networks)**
- Introduction to GAN architecture
- Generator vs Discriminator training dynamics
- DCGANs for image generation
- Conditional GANs
- Applications: Face generation, style transfer, image super-resolution
